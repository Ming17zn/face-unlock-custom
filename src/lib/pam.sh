# Putting face unlock in front of sudo, polkit's admin prompts and the lock
# screens of Hyprland and Niri, and taking it out again.
#
# The lock screens of Plasma and GNOME do not go through this at all: the
# agent opens them (see src/agent/lockcontroller.h). hyprlock, swaylock and
# the others are programs of their own that only open themselves, so the face
# goes into their password check, and pressing Enter on the empty field is
# how a scan starts. The login screen stays with the password: logging in is
# what unlocks the wallet, and a face has no password to hand it.
#
# The line that goes in:
#
#   -auth  sufficient  /usr/lib/security/pam_face_unlock.so
#
# with "lockscreen" after it for a lock screen (see the PAM module).
#
# "sufficient": a match lets the person in, anything else falls through to the
# lines below as if this one were not there. The dash makes PAM skip it
# quietly if the module ever goes missing, say because the package was removed
# without turning this off first. sudo keeps working either way.
#
# Where the service's file is:
#   - /etc/pam.d/<service> exists: the line goes in before its first auth
#     line, with a comment saying where it came from.
#   - only the distribution's copy in /usr/lib/pam.d exists (Arch keeps
#     polkit-1 there): a small /etc/pam.d/<service> is written that puts the
#     line first and includes the distribution's file for everything else, so
#     an update to that file still counts.
# Undoing takes out exactly those lines, or that file.
