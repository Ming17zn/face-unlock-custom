// The window the bubble lives in.
//
// A layer-shell surface on the overlay layer, anchored to the top edge and
// transparent to input, so it floats above everything the way the island on a
// phone does and never takes a click or a key from what is under it.
//
// On top of that it asks KWin to keep showing it while the screen is locked
// (kde_lockscreen_overlay_v1). KWin only grants that to programs whose desktop
// file lists the interface, which the one installed with this does. The
// request has to be made for every new surface role, before it is mapped, so
// it is repeated each time the window is shown again.
//
// Other compositors have no such thing: on Hyprland and Niri the lock screen
// covers the bubble, which shows the tick once it is gone. GNOME has no
// layer-shell at all; there face-unlock's GNOME Shell extension draws the
// bubble (BubbleService).
