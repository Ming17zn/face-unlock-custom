# Builds the tarball for Arch Linux into dist/. The AUR package
# face-unlock-bin is made from it.
#
# Like the deb and the rpm, it holds what `make install` produced, under a
# folder named like the tarball. One thing is different: OpenCV is linked in
# statically (packaging/build-opencv.sh), so a new OpenCV on Arch does not
# break the daemon. Qt stays shared. The agent uses Qt's private API, so the
# tarball fits the Qt that Arch had when it was built.
#
# Needs: make, cmake, a C++ compiler, the packages check.yml installs (without
# opencv), msgfmt (gettext), scdoc, curl, zstd, and the static OpenCV:
#
#   packaging/build-opencv.sh && packaging/build-tarball.sh
