## v2.1.0

_2026-09-28_

Welcome to face-unlock `v2.1.0`! It now gets out of the way during video calls: when another app uses the camera, you type your password right away. sudo and admin prompts take your face from the start.

## v2.0.0

_2026-09-26_

Welcome to face-unlock `v2.0.0`! plasma-face-unlock has a new name, because it no longer needs Plasma: it now works on GNOME, Hyprland and Niri too.

<p align="center">

</p>

### 🚨 Breaking changes

- plasma-face-unlock is now called face-unlock, and so is the command. Your faces and settings move over on their own.
- On Arch, `yay -S face-unlock` replaces the old package.
- On Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu the repository moved too. Remove the old `plasma-face-unlock` repository file and add the new one from the [install steps](https://github.com/LoonixTools/face-unlock#install).

### Highlights

- Works on GNOME, Hyprland and Niri
- Unlock hyprlock, swaylock, gtklock and waylock with your face
- A lock screen of its own, with the bubble and your wallpaper
- 12 new languages
- A warning when no polkit agent runs

## v1.0.1

_2026-09-24_

A small update that makes everyday use smoother. You no longer have to blink: the basic photo check is now the default, and it still stops a photo on a phone, a tablet or glossy paper. If you want the blink back, set **Photo check** to `strict` in the settings.

The settings are now grouped and explain the selected one, the animations are a little calmer, and the lock screen unlocks as soon as your face matches.

## v1.0.0

_2026-09-23_

Welcome to the very first release of plasma-face-unlock! It brings Face ID to KDE Plasma: look at the screen and it unlocks. The lock screen, sudo and admin prompts can all take your face instead of a password.

</p>

### Highlights

- Unlock the lock screen with your face
- sudo and admin prompts
- A bubble like Face ID
- Photos do not get in
- Packages for Arch, Fedora, Debian and Kubuntu
